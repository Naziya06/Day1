    <h1>CSS</h1>
    <p>CSS stands for Cascading Style Sheets.CSS saves a lot of work. It can control the layout of multiple web pages all at once.
        With CSS, you can control the color, font, the size of text, the spacing between elements, how elements are positioned and laid out, what background images or background colors are to be used, different displays for different devices and screen sizes, and much more!
        <h2>Using CSS</h2>
        <P>CSS can be added to HTML documents in 3 ways:
            <br>Inline - by using the style attribute inside HTML elements<br>
            Internal - by using a style element in the head section<br>
            External - by using a link element to link to an external CSS file</P>
        </p>
        <h1>CSS Syntax</h1>
        <p>A CSS rule consists of a selector and a declaration block:<br><pre>

            <img src="https://www.w3schools.com/whatis/img_selector.gif"><br>
            
            The selector points to the HTML element to style (h1).<br>
            The declaration block (in curly braces) contains one or more declarations separated by semicolons.<br>
            Each declaration includes a CSS property name and a value, separated by a colon.</pre></p>
        <h1>CSS Colors, Fonts and Sizes</h1>
