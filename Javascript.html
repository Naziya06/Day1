    <h1>JAVASCRIPT</h1>
    <P>JavaScript is a lightweight, cross-platform, single-threaded, and interpreted compiled programming language. It is also known as the scripting language for webpages. It is well-known for the development of web pages, and many non-browser environments also use it.<br>
        JavaScript is a weakly typed language (dynamically typed). JavaScript can be used for Client-side developments as well as Server-side developments. JavaScript is both an imperative and declarative type of language. JavaScript contains a standard library of objects, like Array, Date, and Math, and a core set of language elements like operators, control structures, and statements. </P>
        <h3>Client-side:</h3> 
        <p>It supplies objects to control a browser and its Document Object Model (DOM). Like if client-side extensions allow an application to place elements on an HTML form and respond to user events such as mouse clicks, form input, and page navigation. Useful libraries for the client side are AngularJS, ReactJS, VueJS, and so many others.</p>
        <h3>Server-side:</h3> 
        <p>It supplies objects relevant to running JavaScript on a server. For if the server-side extensions allow an application to communicate with a database, and provide continuity of information from one invocation to another of the application, or perform file manipulations on a server. The useful framework which is the most famous these days is node.js.</p>
        <h1>Applications of JavaScript</h1>
        <p><h3>Web Development:</h3>
            <p>Adding interactivity and behavior to static sites JavaScript was invented to do this in 1995. By using AngularJS that can be achieved so easily.</p>
           <h3>Web Applications:</h3>  
           <p>With technology, browsers have improved to the extent that a language was required to create robust web applications. When we explore a map in Google Maps then we only need to click and drag the mouse. All detailed view is just a click away, and this is possible only because of JavaScript. It uses Application Programming Interfaces(APIs) that provide extra power to the code. The Electron and React are helpful in this department.
            Server Applications: With the help of Node.js, JavaScript made its way from client to server and Node.js is the most powerful on the server side.</p>
            <h3>Games:</h3>
            <p>Not only in websites, but JavaScript also helps in creating games for leisure. The combination of JavaScript and HTML 5 makes JavaScript popular in game development as well. It provides the EaseJS library which provides solutions for working with rich graphics.</p>
           <h3>Smartwatches:</h3>
           <p>JavaScript is being used in all possible devices and applications. It provides a library PebbleJS which is used in smartwatch applications. This framework works for applications that require the Internet for their functioning.</p>
            <h3>Art:</h3> 
            <p>Artists and designers can create whatever they want using JavaScript to draw on HTML 5 canvas, and make the sound more effective also can be used p5.js library.</p>
            <h3>Machine Learning:</h3> 
            <p>This JavaScript ml5.js library can be used in web development by using machine learning.</p>
            <h3>Mobile Applications:</h3> 
            <p>JavaScript can also be used to build an application for non-web contexts. The features and uses of JavaScript make it a powerful tool for creating mobile applications. This is a Framework for building web and mobile apps using JavaScript. Using React Native, we can build mobile applications for different operating systems. We do not require to write code for different systems. Write once use it anywhere!</p></p>
